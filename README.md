# Perfect-Python-Calculator.

It is a calculator that I thought was the best among the calculators I have made so far.

How to use:

Download Calculator.zip in the release:
https://github.com/Believe0127/Perfect-Python-Calculator./releases/tag/CalculatorV5

Just unzip and run 'Calculator.exe' inside the zip.
If it doesn't start, please install python.
